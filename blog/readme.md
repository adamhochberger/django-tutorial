# Django Tutorial

This repository will be used similar to a sandbox for features based on content from LinkedIn Learning and StackSkills courses. The end-goal of this testing is to create a portfolio-based website to show other personal projects, while also functioning similar to a dev blog. That project will likely be placed in a separate repository so that I can begin from the ground-up and utilize test-driven development principles. Additionally, I will seek to create it in Django 3+ as this current implementation is based on Django 2.1.4.

I've already begun to transition this project from the included SQLite3 to PostgreSQL as I expect to deploy the finished portfolio website to Heroku and a file-based system in SQLite would not be suitable. 

TODO: Verify that usage of PostgreSQL is working as expected 
TODO: Start transitioning to Django 3
TODO: Create test cases for new application and build skeleton code
